          question: "How does Invisalign work?",
          answer:
            "Invisalign uses a series of custom-made, clear aligners to gradually shift your teeth into the desired position. These aligners are virtually invisible and can be removed for eating and brushing. Every two weeks, you switch to a new set of aligners, which continue to move your teeth. The treatment duration varies depending on the complexity of your case, but most patients achieve their results within 6-18 months. Invisalign offers a comfortable, discreet alternative to traditional braces.",

          question: "Are braces only for children?",
          answer:
            "No, braces are effective for patients of all ages. Many adults seek orthodontic treatment to improve their smiles and oral health. Modern options like clear braces and Invisalign make it easier for adults to straighten their teeth discreetly. Orthodontic care can also address issues like jaw misalignment and uneven wear, improving functionality and aesthetics. Regardless of age, it’s never too late to achieve a healthier, more confident smile through braces or aligners.",

          question: "How often should I visit during orthodontic treatment?",
          answer:
            "During orthodontic treatment, regular visits are crucial for monitoring progress and making adjustments. Typically, patients visit every 4-6 weeks. These appointments ensure your braces or aligners are functioning properly and that your teeth are moving as planned. Missing appointments can delay treatment and affect results. Our orthodontic team works closely with you to schedule convenient appointments and provide the support you need throughout the process.",

        {
          question: "What foods should I avoid with braces?",
          answer:
            "With braces, it’s best to avoid hard, sticky, and chewy foods, as they can damage brackets and wires. Foods like popcorn, nuts, caramel, and gum are common culprits. Cut raw fruits and vegetables into smaller pieces to prevent strain on your braces. Our team provides a detailed list of dietary recommendations to help you maintain a balanced diet while protecting your orthodontic appliances. Careful eating habits ensure your treatment stays on track.",

          question: "How can orthodontics improve oral health?",
          answer:
            "Orthodontics not only enhances the appearance of your smile but also improves overall oral health. Straight teeth are easier to clean, reducing the risk of cavities and gum disease. Proper alignment also alleviates issues like jaw pain, uneven wear, and difficulty chewing. By addressing these concerns, orthodontics contributes to long-term oral health and functionality. Our team designs personalized treatment plans to achieve optimal results for both aesthetics and health.",
